## My Reflection
The lessons that I thought for Big Idea 3 were 3.6 Conditionals and 3.7 Nested Conditionals

Homework assignments that I submitted for  Sprint 2 were:

Here is a link to my issue where you can view how I graded myself for Sprint 2:

Hi my name is Avika, and I part of team 4 and we taught the lesson 3.6 and 3.7 which was respectively, conditionals and nested conditionals. For context, when I came into this class, I had a general foundation of coding as I knew python, HTML, and some CSS. 

<h3 style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong> Big Ideas & Teaching </strong> </h3>

Throughout Sprint 2, I learned many valuable lessons in coding through my peer's lessons which I will use to prepare for the college board AP test and project based learning which we will have in the future. 

<h3 style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong> Growth and Memory </strong> </h3>

A memorable experience that helped me learn a lot was working together with my team while avoiding merge conflicts. Experiencing some rejected pull requests from Mr. Mortenson really improved my understanding of github. Something that was memorable from our 3.6 and 3.7 presenation was lots of interaction with the students. 


<h3 style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong> Relavancy <strong> </h3>

We asked many questions through our quiz which helped us keep the audience more engaged. Something unique that I saw in others' presentations was the use of buttons turning green to show the correct answers. 


<h3 style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong> Beyond Perfunctory </strong> </h3>

Something that enhanced my personal growth was doing the homework hacks. I did the homework thoroughly which helped me better implement some newly learned concepts like dictionaries, DeMorgan's law, etc. To summarize, I came into this class with a general coding background, but learning from sprint 2 has made my understanding much stronger.
