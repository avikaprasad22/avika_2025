## Setting Up Tools
<h3 style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong> My journey cruising through the Tools and Equipment documenation went pretty smooth. By typing the commands listed, I was able to download the necessary tools like Ruby, Python, Jupyter, etc. Something new that I learned during the setup process was the rm -rf command. This command was actually very useful to me as I had some errors present the first time I cloned the template repository. I documented my learning of the rm -rf command as an issue on my github account! Click the button below to access it. </strong> </h3>

## Problems
<h3 style="font-family: Courier New"> <strong> A problem that I faced was not being able to commit code changes to my repository that I opened in VSCode. I wasn't sure why I was not connected to the very repository I cloned so I asked some students for help. By utilizing some soft skills, I was able to figure out that github didn't have access to my repository due to some security aspect. I typed in the command <code> git config --global --add safe.directory/nighthawk/avika_2025</code> This ended up giving me version control and now I can commit!</strong> </h3>
