## My Journey : Setting Up Tools
<h3 style="background-color: #FFFFFF"> My journey crusing through the Tools and Equipment documenation went pretty smooth. By typing the commands listed, I was able to download the necessary tools like Ruby, Python, Jupyter, etc. </h3>

## Problems
<h3 style="background-color: #FFFFFF"> A problem that I am currently facing is not being able to commit code changes to my repository that I opened in VSCode. I am not sure why I don't have access to version control, but I have sent out my issue on slack. I hope to recieve a solution to my problem soon. </h3>
