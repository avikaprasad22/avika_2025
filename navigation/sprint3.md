## Accomplishments of Sprint 3
Throughout Sprint 3, my group and I worked on establishing DNHS Cafe, a branch of our period's overall social media theme, Share and Care. DNHS Cafe is a study room created for all Del Norte High School students to chat with each other and clear doubts about any assignments. The more you chat and help out your peers, the more D'neros you earn which you can use to purchase coffee! 

One of my big accomplishments for Sprint 3 was designing the frontend of the cafe and the homepage. I feel that I strengthened those frontend skills from sprint 1 and 2. I was able to implement a function which bought the coffees and decreased the D'Nero balance through the click on a button. I developed a user-friendly UI. Ihave also started to understand the work of databases which connects frontend and backened and want to deepen my understanding of that more as I figure out the backened for our project.


## 2018 AP CSP MC - Test Corrections

Here are some questions from the MC that I reflected back on:

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/cbq1">
<b>Mistake:</b> For the missing code, we need to assign "second" the value of first, therefore, assigning "temp" to "second" does no gopd.
<b>Correct Answer:</b> The correct answer is B as it assigns "temp", which is set to the inital value of "first" is assigned to second. This successfully swaps the values of "frist" and "second".

<br>

<b>Mistake:</b> The answer choice I selected, gives an equal chance of selection to all three colors even though red is 4x larger.
<b>Correct Answer:</b> The correct answer is D as the code segment selects "Yellow" one-sixth of the time, "Blue" one-sixth of the time, and "Red" the remaining two-thirds of the time.

<br>

<b>Mistake:</b> The answer choice I selected, would be proper for 11 years (1 year in the future), but the questions asks for 2 years in the future, so the value at 12 years.
<b>Correct Answer:</b> The correct answer is B as the 31.2 million matches the approximation for 12 years based on the way the rate has been increasing over the years in the table.

<br>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/cbq4">
<b>Mistake:</b> The answer choice I selected, proposes two ways to get from P to S. For example, P to R to S and P to Q to S. This makes redundancy possible.
<b>Correct Answer:</b> The correct answer is B as redundant routing is impossible if there is only one possible path from one device to another. There is only one possible path from P to S (P to R to Q to S).

<br>
<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/images/cbq5">
<b>Mistake:</b> In the answer choice I selected, it approximation assumes that the Analysis procedure is called only once.
<b>Correct Answer:</b> D, 5 hours is correct because each call to the Analysis procedure requires one hour of program execution time. The procedure is called once before the loop, and then four times inside the loop (once for each of the four entries in One word, genre List). Therefore, the program will take approximately 5 hours to execute. S).

## What I learned
Through this collegeboard MC, I learned many new concepts such as internet protocols and many cryptography methods and its applications. I thought those questions were interesting.

## What I need to improve on
After taking the collegeboard MC, I need to improve on the time I spend onf each question, and therefore I have to get faster the questions that require you to test out the logic. These were like moving the robot kind of questions. They had tricky things hidden in the code that I sometimes missed as I was trying to not take too long on any question.
