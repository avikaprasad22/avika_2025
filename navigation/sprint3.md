## Accomplishments of Sprint 3
Throughout Sprint 3, my group and I worked on establishing DNHS Cafe, a branch of our period's overall social media theme, Share and Care. DNHS Cafe is a study room created for all Del Norte High School students to chat with each other and clear doubts about any assignments. The more you chat and help out your peers, the more D'neros you earn which you can use to purchase coffee! 

One of my big accomplishments for Sprint 3 was designing the frontend of the cafe and the homepage. I feel that I strengthened those frontend skills from sprint 1 and 2. I was able to implement a function which bought the coffees and decreased the D'Nero balance through the click on a button. I developed a user-friendly UI. Ihave also started to understand the work of databases which connects frontend and backened and want to deepen my understanding of that more as I figure out the backened for our project.
