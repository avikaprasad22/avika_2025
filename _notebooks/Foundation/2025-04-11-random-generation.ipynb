    "**Question: Name two real-world applications where random number generation is essential and briefly explain why.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Cryptography\n",
    "Random numbers are used to generate encryption keys, which keep data secure during communication (like HTTPS websites, encrypted messages, or banking apps). If these keys weren't random, hackers could easily predict them and break into systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Simulations (Weather Forecasting or Risk Analysis)\n",
    "Random numbers help model uncertainty in complex systems. For example, in weather forecasting, simulations run thousands of scenarios with slight variations (powered by random numbers) to predict likely outcomes. Similarly, in finance or engineering, Monte Carlo simulations use random numbers to estimate risk or performance under uncertain conditions."
