    "    - Learned to work on projects that are full-class scale, opposed to solely group-scale (CSP)\n",

    "My project demonstrates several core AP CSA concepts through real-world application. I used APIs, specifically the Google Maps API, to handle location data, routing, and interactive map elements, which reflects how programs often interact with external libraries to extend functionality. I applied object-oriented programming principles by organizing the app’s data into logical structures similar to classes and objects. For example, each bike station behaves like an object with its own properties such as ID, location, capacity, and availability. I also designed methods (implemented as JavaScript functions) to perform specific tasks like reserving bikes, planning routes, and managing schedules."
