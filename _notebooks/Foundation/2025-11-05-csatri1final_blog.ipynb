    "    - Had limited experience with Java or programming concepts.\n",
    "    - Unsure how to approach larger coding projects (collboration with full class)\n",
    "\n",
    "### After:\n",
    "    - Know a lot more about Java syntax and fundamentals through Unit 1 lesson homeworks\n",
    "    - Learned to work on projects that are full-class scale, opposed to solely group-scale (CSP)\n",
    "    - Improved on how to present plans and ideas (again, through more small-meetings and class collaboration)."
