    "## Free Response Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Why is binary search more efficient for large data than linear search?\n",
    "Binary search cuts the search range in half with each step, making it much faster for large datasets—its time complexity is O(log n) compared to O(n) for linear search. This means it can find items in millions of entries with only a few comparisons.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What happens if the list isn’t sorted and you try to use binary search?\n",
    "Binary search will give incorrect results or fail entirely if the list isn't sorted, because it relies on the order to decide which half to eliminate. Without sorting, the logic of going left or right based on comparisons breaks down.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Could you use binary search in a video game leaderboard or streaming service search bar? Why or why not?\n",
    "Yes, you could use binary search for a leaderboard if scores are pre-sorted, making it fast to find a player's rank. But for a search bar with partial or fuzzy matches, more flexible algorithms like trie searches or inverted indexes are often better."
